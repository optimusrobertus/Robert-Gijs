        What is machine learning?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Machine learning is the study of algorithms by computers, in order to effectively perform a specific task. 
        Using machine learning, computers will keep learning, and therefore will keep on improving their ability to perform that specific task.
        There are 5 different types of machine learning:
        <table>
          <caption>Types of machine learning:</caption>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Type</th>
              <th>How does it work?</th>
              <th>Usecases</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>

                Supervised learning
              </th>
              <th>
                The computer receives input and output, and learns to recognize reoccuring patterns.
                The data received by the computer program is labeled by a machine learning enginere or data scientist.
              </th>
              <th>
                Spamfilter in your mailbox, face recognition etc.
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>
                Unsupervised learning
              </th>
              <th>
                In unsupervised learning, a computer learns how to group, cluster and/or organize data in such a way taht humans (or other algorithms) can make sense of it.
                The data the program receives is unlabeled.
              </th>
              <th>
                Recommender systems (think of recommended YouTube videos)
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>
                Semi-supervised learning
              </th>
              <th>
                Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.
                This means that the computer program receives both labeled and unlabeled data. 
                This is done, because labeling is timeconsuming, and prone to human error. 
                Thus, by adding unlabeled data, the eventual algorithm produced will be more accurate.
              </th>
              <th>
                Speech recognition, genetic sequencing etc.
              </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>
                Reinforcement learning
              </th>
              <th>
                In this type of learning, a computer learns by analyzing its mistakes, and will improve on said mistakes. 
                I like to think of it as evolution, as a computer program adjusts itself to its environment.
              </th>
              <th>
                Robotics, deep learning, games etc.

        Machine learning in our daily lives
      </h3>  
      <p>
        Everyday, we make use of machine learning. When you wake up, and open YouTube, to check out the latest videos in your feed, those videos have been selected using machine learning.
        <br>
        When you ask Siri what the weather is like today, or ask Google Assistant what's on your schedule for the day, the responses have been produced by the use of machine learning.
        That is because these programs need to recognize speech, questions and orders, and need to know how to properly respond.

        And now, to answer what this website is all about, shoudl we be afraid of machine learning?
